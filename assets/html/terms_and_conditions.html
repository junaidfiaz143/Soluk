Soluk Technology shall advance the costs of such binding arbitration, but you agree that should Soluk Technology prevail in the arbitration, Soluk Technology is entitled to reimbursement of all costs. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration will be held in Boston, MA before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or if the parties cannot mutually agree, a single arbitrator appointed by J.A.M.S./Undisputed, Inc., and will be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by J.A.M.S./ Undisputed, Inc. unless specifically modified in the Terms of Use. The arbitration must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is filed by either party. The arbitrator will have the power to order the production of documents by each party and any third-party witnesses. In addition, each party may take up to three (3) depositions as of right, and the arbitrator will not have the power to order the answering of interrogatories or the responses to requests for admission or the inspection of premises.

The arbitrator will not have the power to award damages more than the limitation on actual compensatory damages set forth in the Terms of Use and may not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages that are specifically excluded under the Terms of Use, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. The parties covenant and agree that they will participate in the arbitration in good faith. The arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing part) against any party to a proceeding. Any party refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators will be liable for costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for avoiding</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">immediate and irreparable harm. The provisions of this arbitration section will be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Termination</h4><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You agree that Soluk Technology, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Soluk Technology believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Use.

These Terms of Use shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Soluk Technology agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Boston, Ma. Each of the parties hereby knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation (including but not limited to any claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, or third party claims) arising out of, under or about this agreement. Further, each party hereto certifies that no representative or agent of either party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not in the event of such litigation, seek to enforce this waiver of right to jury trial provision. Each of the parties acknowledges that this section is a material inducement for the other party entering this Terms of Use. The failure of Soluk Technology to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Use remain in full force and effect.

The section titles in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Use or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Your Privacy</h4><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At Soluk Technology, we respect the privacy of our users.
